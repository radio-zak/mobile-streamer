# mobile-streamer

Simple multi-platform radio streaming app. Uses Flutter with just_audio and just_audio_background libraries.  
Created for Studenckie Radio ŻAK Politechniki Łódzkiej, therefore appropriate branding is applied. Make sure to remove all associated branding if you wish to use this app as scaffolding for your own projects
